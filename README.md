# Wigner Function

## Description

This project is designed to calculate and visualize the Wigner function for a given 1D wavefunction using numerical methods.
The numerical method for integration chosen is the adaptive Simpson rule because of the possible oscillatory nature of the 
wavefunction, needing an accurate numerical integration method. The computational needs of this method require to stay in low dimension.
The Wigner function is a quasi-probability distribution function that provides a phase-space representation of quantum states.

## Possible improvement

(1) Addition of the MC integration to be able to deal with higher dimensions

(2) Implementation of the higher dimension Wigner function
